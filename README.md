# WordCount


We all wonder it. *How* many times does the word "difficult" appear in Jan Arkless's cookbook magnum opus, ["How To Boil An Egg"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/How-Boil-Egg-Jan-Arkless/0716022206)?

This problem frustrated me until I learned to code. Now I've written a JavaScript web application that can count the occurrences of **all** words in a text file.

I can even tell if the word-count of a specific word happens to be a prime number. Excellent! Back to cooking this egg.
